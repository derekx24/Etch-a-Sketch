# Etch-a-Sketch

This application will allow users to be able to draw whatever they want on a canvas grid. This application was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Someone who may want to draw or create pixel art can find this webpage to be useful. Some features that I might implement later on are allowing the user to export their image and an undo button to remove their last mark on the canvas.

***Users are able to: ***

- Select any color to draw with
- Erase anything on the canvas
- Use a rainbow brush
- Clear/reset the entire canvas
- Select how fine the pixels are, such as a 10x10 or a 64x64 grid
