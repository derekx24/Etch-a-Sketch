# Etch-a-Sketch

This application will allow users to be able to draw whatever they want on a canvas grid. This application was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Someone who may want to draw or create pixel art can find this webpage to be useful. 

### Users are able to: 

- Select any color to draw with
- Erase anything on the canvas
- Use a rainbow brush
- Clear/reset the entire canvas
- Select how fine the pixels are, such as a 10x10 or a 64x64 grid

### What I learned:

- How to create a grid of HTML elements using only JavaScript to generate it
- How to implement a slider with the left side filled up, and receive input from it
- How to get input from multiple buttons, and to change the state of the buttons so only one can be used at one time
- Using different inputs such as sliders, color wheels, and buttons

### Some features that I might implement in the future are:

- are allowing the user to export their image
- undo button to remove their last mark on the canvas
- a option to allow users to choose the opacity of their color
